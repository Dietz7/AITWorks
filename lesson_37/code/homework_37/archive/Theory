1. public int compareTo(Document o){}

Full Explanation
Compare folderId values:

The method first compares the folderId of the current document with the folderId of the document being compared.
If the folderIds are different, it immediately returns the result of this comparison.
Compare documentId values if folderIds are equal:

If the folderIds are the same, it then compares the documentId values.
The result of this second comparison determines the order of the documents with the same folderId.
Example
Let's assume we have two Document objects, doc1 and doc2.

doc1.folderId = 1, doc1.documentId = 10
doc2.folderId = 1, doc2.documentId = 5
When doc1.compareTo(doc2) is called:

Integer.compare(doc1.folderId, doc2.folderId) returns 0 because both folderId are 1.
Since res is 0, it compares documentId values.
Integer.compare(doc1.documentId, doc2.documentId) returns a positive value (because 10 > 5).
Therefore, doc1 is considered greater than doc2 when sorted.

SUMMARY
The compareTo method provides a way to sort Document objects first by folderId and, if they are equal, then by documentId.
This implementation ensures a consistent and predictable ordering of Document instances.

2. boolean addDocument(Document document);
Potential Implementation and Use
The actual implementation of the addDocument method will vary based on the class in which it is defined.
Hereâ€™s a basic example to illustrate how such a method might be implemented within a class that manages
a collection of Document objects:
EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION (using ArrayList)

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class DocumentManager {

    private List<Document> documents; // The documents list stores Document objects.
    //It is private, so it can only be accessed and modified through the class's methods.

    public DocumentManager() {
        this.documents = new ArrayList<>(); //Constructor
        // The constructor initializes the documents list as an EMPTY ArrayList.
    }

    public boolean addDocument(Document document) {
        if (document == null) {
            return false; // Adding a null document is not allowed
        }
        return documents.add(document); // Adds the document to the list and returns true if successful
    }

   ADDITIONAL METHOD:
   // This method returns the list of documents. It provides a way to access the documents that have been added.
    public List<Document> getDocuments() {
        return documents;
    }
}
